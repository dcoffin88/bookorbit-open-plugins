 *
 * A project arrives as one zip of per-chapter MP3s rather than as a single file. BookOrbit's import
 * path handles that: the zip is named as a container, extracted, and imported as one audiobook of
 * many ordered tracks.
 *
 * Dependency free and single file on purpose. A plugin runs inside the BookOrbit process with that
 * process's access, so it has to be something a person can read start to finish before trusting it.
